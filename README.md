# bogosort-asm

Implementation of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogosort](Bogosort) in MSP430 Assembly. Written for the MSP430FR5994.

To sort an array, enter the appropriate numbers and array size in `main.asm` next to `ARR` and `ARR_LEN`, respectively. `ARR_OUT` should be an array of zeroes of the same size.

Takes about 30 seconds to sort 5 numbers.

Why have I done this :/
